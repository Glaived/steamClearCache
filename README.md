# steamClearCache

steamClearCahe is a simple program that will flush the Steam cache before launching Steam Client. I made this program to solve the problem of freez / lag in several users on 2017-07-23 expect a patch from Steam.

**Warning:** The program is only available for Windows, and will only work if your Steam software is installed in the following directory : `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`

### Running steamClearCache on computer startup

1. Disable automatic startup of Steam. [See here](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/disable-startup-programs-windows-10/)
2. Press on `⌘ + R` (⌘ = Windows key)
3. Type `shell:startup`
4. Press enter.
5. Move the exe file in this folder or create a shortcut in this folder.
